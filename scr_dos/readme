This directory contains LightPipes.1.2 scripts for DOS.

All scripts are tested and work fine with LightPipes.1.2.

If you have not Ghostview installed in your system, "show" will
produce an error. With Ghostscript (available from Simtel) you
may convert Postscript output into almost any graphical format.

Some of these scripts will not work with the demo version of
LightPipes.1.2  producing a message with ordering information.
