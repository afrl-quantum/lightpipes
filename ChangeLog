	* Field.C, Field.h: Changed lens and t_lens functions so that focal
        length f is positive for f>0 (this is unlike the original lightpipes
        code).  This also involved changing the spherical_coords convert
        function and the lens.C and t_lens.C programs so that they do not add
        the extra minus sign when calling lens and t_lens.
