/** \page intro Introduction
    This page introduces the user to the topic.

/** \page cpp C++ Interface

    This is the initial skeleton of documentation.
    
    Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".

/** \page octave Octave Interface

    This is the initial skeleton of documentation.  In this section, I
    describe the GNU/Octave interface to LightPipes.
    
    Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".

/** \page python Python Interface

    This is the initial skeleton of documentation.  In this section, I
    describe the Python interface to LightPipes.
    
    Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".
*/

/** \page cmdline Command-line Interface

    This is the initial skeleton of documentation.  In this section, I
    describe the command-line interface to LightPipes.  This interface should
    be very compatible with the initial c-code. 
    
    Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".
