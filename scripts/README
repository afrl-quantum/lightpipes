Note that these scripts may not work well with this c++ version of lightpipes.
I think I kept the arguments to the various programs the same, but can't
remember.  Furthermore, there are a few programs/functions that I didnt'
finish yet.  I plan to finish all the functions/programs at some time.  I also
plan to either to rework or at least verify the status of these scripts.
