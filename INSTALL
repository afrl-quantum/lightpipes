Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses the Boost.Build system which automatically tracks link,
include, and other dependencies among any number of libraries and projects.
Below, you should find instructions for using Boost.Build as well as a general
system-style installtion.

Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  EASY.  No installation beyond storing the packages somewhere on your harddrive.  To
  use lightpipes in your Boost.Build project, you simply include a line like:

      use-project /lightpipes : path/to/lightpipes ;

  where the path/to/lightpipes path can be either relative or absolute.  


  External libraries required by various components:
    Boost.Python


General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help
