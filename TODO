1.
    Finish porting the code in some of the old c-programs into the c++ Field
    class.

2.
    Reimplement the command-line access programs to this code.

3.
    Implement multilayer transmission/reflection code that appears to be added
    to the commercial Matlab version.  This can easily be done using the
    multilayer code from the XUVMulti program/library.  (I have been meaning
    to visit XUVMulti again for some time to clean it up and package it.)

4.
    Add a lot of examples for:
    a.  The octave interface to the package
    b.  The commandline interface.  This mostly involves upgrading fixing the
        scripts that were part of the original c-code. 
    c.  The c++ interface.

5.
    Extend and finish the inline doxygen comments for the library.

6.
    Generate the doxygen documentation as a part of the install.
